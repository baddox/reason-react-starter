# Installation

Just clone, `cd` into the directory, and run `yarn`.

# Development

Run three tasks in three separate tabs:

```
yarn run start
```

```
yarn run webpack
```

```
yarn run dev
```

The final task runs the webpack dev server where your application will appear!

# Todo

* Consolidate the three crazy npm tasks into just one (presumably the webpack
  dev server).
* Figure out how to require and build CSS (eject reason-scripts and see how they
  do it in their webpack config).
